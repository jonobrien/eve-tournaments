# eve-tournaments

"The deadline in question is May 8th, 2018. On this date, weâ€™ll be shutting down the XML and CREST APIs. Team Tech Co does not take this decision lightly, and we want you to understand why we have made this decision." [source](https://developers.eveonline.com/blog/article/important-information-on-the-future-of-the-eve-api) *no mention of tournament parity...*

Originally this was just going to be a demo showing some public CREST API data, and a possible use case for it. Since then CCP announced the ESI API which will replace both the CREST API and the older XML API. CCP AquarHEAD [replied](https://github.com/ccpgames/esi-issues/issues/296) with a possibly different direction for the endpoints moving forward. So if/when something happens and the data is updated for ESI, I will update and make this demo more legitimate. CCPlease.

Displaying public CREST data grouped by endpoint

```bash
$ npm install
$ node server.js

# endpoints
- /tournaments/
- /tournaments/teams/`<id>`/
- /tournaments/`<id>`/series/
- /tournaments/`<idX>`/series/`<idY>`/matches/
- Eventually contributed to the [docs](https://github.com/ccpgames/eveonline-third-party-documentation/blame/master/docs/crest/eve/eve_tournaments.md)

- will migrate to ESI api when CCP migrates Tournament endpoints. Facelift to happen CCPSoon(tm)

- also hosted on [gh-pages](https://jonobrien.io/evetournaments.com/tournaments.html)
